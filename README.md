## Features

**IPAPatch** includes an template Xcode project, that provides following features:

- **Build & Run third-party ipa with your code injected**

  You can run your own code inside ipa file as a dynamic library. So you can change behavior of that app by utilizing Objective-C runtime.

- **Step-by-step Debugging with lldb**

  You can debug third-party apps like your own. For example:
    
   - Step-by-Step debug your code inside other app
   - Set Breakpoints
   - Print objects in Xcode console with lldb

- **Link external frameworks**

  By linking existing frameworks, you can integrate third-party services to apps very easily, such as Reveal.

## Instructions

1. **Clone or Download This Project**
   
   Download this project to your local disk
   
2. **Prepare Decrypted IPA File**
  
   The IPA file you use need to be decrypted, you can get a decrypted ipa from a jailbroken device or download it directly from an ipa download site, such as http://www.iphonecake.com
  
3. **Replace Placeholder IPA**

   Replace the IPA file located at `IPAPatch/Assets/app.ipa` with yours, this is a placeholder file. The filename should remain `app.ipa` after replacing.
  
4. **Place External Resources/Frameworks (Optional)**
   
   Follow types of external file are supported:
   - **Frameworks**: 
     - External frameworks can be placed at `IPAPatch/Assets/Frameworks` folder. 
     - Frameworks will be linked automatically.     
     - For example `IPAPatch/Assets/Frameworks/RevealServer.framework`
   - **Dynamic Libraries**: 
     - External dynamic libraries can be placed at `IPAPatch/Assets/Dylibs` folder. 
     - Libraries will be linked automatically
   - **Resources/Bundles**: 
     - Other resources or bundles can be placed at `IPAPatch/Assets/Resources`
     - Resources will be copied directly to the main bundle of original app
  
5. **Configure Build Settings**

   - Open `IPAPatch.xcodeproj`
   - In the Project Editor, Select Target `IPAPatch-DummyApp`
   - `Display Name` defaults to "ðŸ’Š", this is used as prefix of the final display name.
   - Change `Bundle Identifier` to match your provisioning profiles
   - Fix signing issues if any.

6. **Configure IPPatch Options**

   - You can config IPAPatch's behavior with `Tools/options.plist`
   
        | Name | Description | Default |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | RESTORE_SYMBOLS  | When `YES`, IPAPatch will try to restore symbol table from Mach-O for debugging propose (with tools from https://github.com/tobefuturer/restore-symbol, also thanks to @henrayluo and @dannion) | NO |
        | CREATE_IPA_FILE | When `YES`, IPAPatch will generate a ipa file on each build. Genrated file is located at `SRCROOT/Product` | NO |
        | IGNORE_UI_SUPPORTED_DEVICES | When `YES`, IPAPatch will delete `UISupportedDevices` from source app's `Info.plist` | NO |
        | REMOVE_WATCHPLACEHOLDER | When `YES`, IPAPatch will remove `com.apple.WatchPlaceholder` folder from source app's bundle | YES |
        | USE_ORIGINAL_ENTITLEMENTS | When `YES`, IPAPatch will use source app's entitlements to resign, you need to make sure your Provisioning Profile matches the entitlements, or you need to disable `AMFI` on target device | NO |

7. **Code Your Patch**

   The entry is at `+[IPAPatchEntry load]`, you can write code start from here. To change apps' behavior, You may need to use some method swizzling library, such as [steipete/Aspects](https://github.com/steipete/Aspects).

8. **Build and Run**

   Select a real device, select the `IPAPatch-DummyApp` scheme and hit the "Run" button at the top-left corner of Xcode. The code your wrote and external frameworks you placed will inject to the ipa file automatically.

## Example

I created some demo project, which shows you how to use `IPAPatch`:

- Reveal + Youtube: 
  - https://github.com/Naituw/IPAPatch/releases/tag/1.0
- Cycript + Youtube (Idea from @phpmaple): 
  - https://github.com/Naituw/IPAPatch/releases/tag/1.0.1

## FAQ

- Q: Library not loaded with reason: `mach-o, but wrong architecture` ?
  - A: Try set `IPAPatch` target's `Valid Architectures` to match your ipa binary's architecture.

- Q: process launch failed: Unspecified (Disabled) ?
  - A: The ipa file use with IPAPatch must be decrypted, See step.2 of Instructions.

- Q: dyld: Symbol not found: XXX, Referenced from: XXX, Expected in: XXX/libswiftXXX.dylib
  - The swift version the framework you injecting use, is incompatible with the version of your Xcode
